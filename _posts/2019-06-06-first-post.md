    z = np.sum(x, y)
    return z
```

R code block:
```r
    library(tidyverse)

Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's an image:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/network.jpg" alt="">

Here's another image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/network.jpg)
