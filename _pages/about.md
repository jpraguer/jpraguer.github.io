excerpt:
  <br>Hi! :wave: I'm a data analyst/scientist, currently exploring new opportunities in tech, ideally working on products I feel passionate about. :fire: I specialise in exploratory analyses and data visualisations. :bar_chart:<br/>
  <small>I currently live in Prague, Czechia, but am keen to travel after the global pandemic subsides. :airplane:</small>

    title: "About Me"
    excerpt: "I grew up in Prague :european_post_office:, but have since lived in the USA, Scotland, and Australia. At university, I studied Economics :money_with_wings: and Psychology :brain:. During my final year, I was introduced to R (the programming language) and realised what a superpower it is to understand data. So I started diving deeply into the mathematics and computer science necessary to apply machine learning. :robot:\n
    \n
    As well as taking online courses alongside fulltime work, I started competing on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zaefir) and [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com). After going through 30+ competitions, I recognised that most of them fit a certain pattern. :chart_with_upwards_trend:\n
    \n
    Therefore, to speed up anyone's start in the tabular ML comps world, I decided to publish a few Python-based :snake: templates for different competition types, that show how to explore relationships between variables, fill null values, or do basic transformations. The templates also establish a simple model baseline, which is useful to set as early as possible, to be able to benchmark future scripts. No feature engineering, hyper parameter tuning or deep learning is included (that's secret sauce for now). :squirrel:\n

    Czech out :wink: the posts section for those ipynbs (they are directly runnable in Google Colab)!\n
    \n
    Cheers! :beers:"
