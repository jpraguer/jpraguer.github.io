excerpt:
  <br>I'm a data scientist, currently exploring new opportunities in tech, ideally working on products I feel passionate about.
  I specialise in exploratory analyses and data visualisations. :smile:<br/>
  <small>I currently live in Prague, Czech Republic, but am keen to travel after the global pandemic subsides.</small>
intro: 
  - excerpt: "After taking online courses in computer science and machine learning alongside fulltime work in the past two years, I started competing on [kaggle](kaggle.com) and [Analytics Vidhya](analyticsvidhya.com). After going through 30+ competitions, I realised that most of them fit a certain pattern. Therefore, to speed up anyone's start in the ML comps world, I decided to publish a few templates for different competition types, that allow to explore relationships between variables, fill null values, do basic transformations, as well as establish a model baseline using state of the art Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models, such as LightGBM or Catboost. Czech out :wink: the posts section for those templates, more will be added as time goes on."
