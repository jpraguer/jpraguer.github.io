excerpt:
  <br>I'm a data scientist, currently exploring new opportunities in tech, ideally working on products I feel passionate about.
  I specialise in exploratory analyses and data visualisations. :smile:<br/>
  <small>I currently live in Prague, Czechia, but am keen to travel after the global pandemic subsides.</small>

    title: "About Me"
    excerpt: "After taking online courses in computer science and machine learning alongside fulltime work, I started competing on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com). After going through 30+ competitions, I realised that most of them fit a certain pattern.\n
    \n
    Therefore, to speed up anyone's start in the (tabular for now) ML comps world, I decided to publish a few templates for different competition types, that show how to explore relationships between variables, fill null values, do basic transformations. The templates also show how to establish a simple model baseline using state of the art Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models, such as LightGBM or Catboost. No feature engineering, hyper parameter tuning or deep learning is included (that's secret sauce for now).\n
    \n
    Czech out :wink: the posts section for those ipynbs (directly runnable in Google Colab), more will be added as time goes on.\n
    \n
    Cheers!"
